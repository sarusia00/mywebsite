<h1>Who am I ???</h1>
    <p>I am 23 years old ordinary girl, who  is fascinated by LIFE, loves travelling, all sorts of DIY, foreign languages, Art, museums, cooking, Harry Potter and recently programming. For a long time I had been thinking I was unable to get into IT world. Great marks from Literature lessons, much worse from Maths or Computer Sciences. I had a great time during my studies at Universuty of Wroclaw. I participated in many youth exchanges and thanks to different scholarships I could study abroad - in Russia, and France. But then I graduated from my lovely Russian Language and Literature and it turned out there are not that many possibilites as I thought there are. So I decided to leave my country and give a try to success in England. I was very confused and I didn't really know what I want to do with my life. Then I found out an Androit app Daily Art. A masterpiece! With one click you gain loads of knowledge. Every day you get one piece of art with its short description. I read the story of the co-founder - Zuzanna Stanska - and she inspired me! Even though she had no expercience in IT she managed to create such a wonderful educational app. This is how I got interested in coding. I decided I want to create equally great stuff and share them with others. This is where my adventure begins...</p>
